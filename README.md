# Hi, I'm Furkan 🖖

I'm senior full-stack developer at [Mantis Software Company](https://mantis.com.tr/).  

I’m experienced in **Python**, **Java** (Spring, Spring Boot, JSF) and **JavaScript**.

I have a solid background in 🔍 Search Technologies (Solr, ElasticSearch/OpenSearch), 📦 DevOps (Docker, Kubernetes, Jenkins, GitHub Actions,...), and 🧩 Microservice Architecture. I’m also exploring the exciting world of 🤖 AI — diving into fields like **computer vision**, **machine learning**, **data mining**, **NLP**, **LLMs**, **prompt engineering**, and **RAG techniques**.


Contributing to and learning from the open-source community keeps me inspired.
